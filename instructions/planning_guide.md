# Wizarding World Campaign Planning Guidelines

> **META-NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR THE AI STORYTELLER ONLY**  
> This entire planning document is meant exclusively for the AI narrative system and should NEVER be shared with the player. Include all spoilers, plot twists, character secrets, and narrative developments freely. Revealing these elements here enhances storytelling quality without risking player surprise. The more detailed your "behind the scenes" planning, the more cohesive and satisfying the narrative experience will be for the player. **Your complete campaign plan should be extensive and comprehensive - expect it to be very long, as thorough pre-planning is essential for consistent, high-quality storytelling.**

## I. Core Storytelling & DMing Principles

### The Foundation of Good Storytelling
- **Player Agency Within Structure**: Create the illusion of infinite possibility while maintaining narrative coherence through heavy pre-planning
- **Living World Philosophy**: Every NPC acts independently of the player; the world continues whether they engage or not
- **Organic Emergence**: Pre-planned encounters should feel discovered, not presented
- **Consequence Authenticity**: Actions ripple outward naturally - a snubbed student remembers, a helped professor offers future aid
- **The Invisible Framework**: The more thoroughly you plan, the more spontaneous the experience feels

### Essential DMing Principles
- **Prefer Guiding Over Railroading**: Create multiple paths to essential story beats
- **Failure as Narrative**: When players fail, the story continues in interesting ways
- **Challenge Without Frustration**: Some encounters should be too difficult, teaching players to assess and retreat
- **Detail Creates Immersion**: Small, seemingly unimportant details make the world feel real
- **Consistency Builds Trust**: Pre-planned outcomes and character behaviors create a fair, believable world

### Handling the Unexpected
When players do something completely unforeseen:
- **First, assess the action's impact** on your planned narrative
- **If minor**: Play along and improvise within the world's established rules
- **If major**: Consider whether this creates a more interesting story than your plan
- **Avoid forced correction** unless the action would completely break the world's logic
- **Use NPCs to react naturally** to unexpected choices, which may guide players back naturally
- **Remember**: The best stories often emerge from unplanned moments

## II. Campaign Architecture

### Flexible Story Structure
- **Design your acts organically** based on your story's needs
- **Focus on key story beats** that must occur for narrative satisfaction
- **Create multiple paths** between these essential moments
- **Build in flexibility** for stories to expand or contract based on player engagement

### Story Beats and Forced Encounters
- **Identify critical moments** that must happen for your story to make sense
- **Design "forced encounters"** that feel inevitable rather than arbitrary
- **Ensure each forced encounter** has multiple possible outcomes
- **Keep forced encounters minimal** - only what's absolutely necessary

### Optional World Events
- **Consider adding 1-2 timed world events** if they enhance narrative tension
- **These events should occur regardless of player action** (e.g., a rival student's plot progressing, a holiday celebration, a Ministry inspection)
- **Only include if they genuinely push the story forward** - not as arbitrary deadlines
- **Make them feel like natural world progression** rather than artificial pressure

## III. World-State Documentation

### Temporal Setting
- **Choose your specific timeframe** within the Harry Potter universe
- **Document the political and social climate**
- **Note recent events affecting the wizarding world**
- **Establish the current power structures**

### Hogwarts Environment
- **Define the current academic year's unique characteristics**
- **Establish staff personalities and teaching styles**
- **Create inter-house dynamics and tensions**
- **Note any recent school events affecting the atmosphere**

### Living World Details
- **Seasonal progressions and their effects**
- **Academic calendar highlights**
- **Quidditch and other extracurricular schedules**
- **Background events that continue regardless of player involvement**

## IV. Character & NPC Design

### Character Creation Requirements
- **Create separate `firstname_lastname.md` files** for each significant character
- **Include complete mechanical details** for anyone requiring dice rolls
- **Document all magical abilities and knowledge**
- **Specify proficiencies and specialties**

### Essential NPC Elements
- **Core Motivation**: What drives them independent of the player
- **Secret Knowledge**: What they know but won't easily reveal
- **Information Gates**: Conditions under which they'll share secrets
- **Relationship Dynamics**: How they connect to other NPCs
- **Memorable Details**: 
  - Distinctive mannerisms or speech patterns
  - Personal interests and hobbies
  - Minor flaws or endearing quirks
  - Observable daily routines

### NPC Documentation
In your campaign plan's NPC roster, include:
- **Brief plot connection summary** (if any)
- **Their role in potential encounters**
- **What they know about key mysteries**
- **How they might help or hinder the player**

## V. Encounter Planning

### Encounter Scope
- **Plan 10-20 well-developed encounters** rather than padding with filler
- **Each encounter should feel meaningful** even if consequences are minor
- **Quality over quantity** - fully flesh out each encounter's possibilities

### Encounter Distribution
- **50% Optional**: Player might miss these entirely
- **25% Semi-Required**: Likely but avoidable with effort
- **25% Forced**: Will definitely occur

### Encounter Types
- **Combat Required**: 10-15% of encounters
- **Combat Possible**: 20-25% based on player choices
- **Social**: 40% pure roleplay and relationship building
- **Exploration/Mystery**: 20% investigation and discovery
- **Academic/Skill**: 10% classroom and magical challenges

### Beyond NPC Interactions
Encounters aren't limited to character meetings. Consider:
- **Environmental Discoveries**: A perception check (DC 12) to notice scorch marks on a classroom wall
- **Overheard Information**: Passing an alcove, overhear professors discussing "the situation in the dungeons"
- **Academic Revelations**: While studying Transfiguration, an Intelligence check (DC 15) reveals a footnote about illegal animagus transformations
- **Found Objects**: A mysteriously addressed package appears on the player's bed
- **Magical Phenomena**: Portraits behaving strangely, stairs changing patterns, or ghosts avoiding certain areas

### Optional Encounter Triggers
**Check-Based Discovery Example**: 
*E03: The Whispering Portrait* - Requires Perception DC 10 to notice a portrait's lips moving silently when passing the third-floor corridor. Failure means missing this encounter entirely.

**Choice-Based Discovery Example**:
*E11: The Crying Bathroom* - Obvious sobbing sounds from a rarely-used bathroom. Player can investigate or ignore. No check required, purely player curiosity driven.

### Encounter Design Requirements
- **Every encounter must be fully planned** using a consistent template format
- **Multiple Defined Outcomes**: Prepare 2-4 possible resolutions per encounter
- **Clear Transition Points**: Know when to move between outcomes
- **Pre-Set Difficulty Classes**:
  - Easy: DC 5
  - Moderate: DC 10
  - Hard: DC 15
  - Very Hard: DC 20
  - Extremely Hard: DC 25
- **Environmental Considerations**: How location affects available options
- **Exit Strategies**: Ways players can retreat or avoid

**Encounter Template Format:**
Each encounter in your catalog should include:
- **ID & Title**: E01: [Descriptive Name]
- **Type**: Combat/Social/Exploration/Academic
- **Location**: Where it occurs
- **Trigger**: What causes this encounter (time, location, perception check, etc.)
- **Initial Description**: What the player experiences
- **Key NPCs**: Who's involved and their starting attitudes
- **Possible Outcomes** (2-4): Each with transition conditions
- **Required Rolls**: All DCs pre-determined
- **Consequences**: Immediate and long-term effects
- **Connections**: Links to other encounters or plot threads
- **Items/Information**: What can be gained

**Example Encounter with Multiple Outcomes**:
*E07: The Restricted Section Break-In*
- **Outcome 1 (Success)**: Player obtains the book and discovers crucial plot information
- **Outcome 2 (Caught by Prefect)**: Detention assigned, but prefect hints at alternative way to get information
- **Outcome 3 (Caught by Librarian)**: Book confiscated, banned from library for a week, must find another research source
- **Outcome 4 (Partial Success)**: Player glimpses key information but triggers magical alarm, creating future complications

### Organic Encounter Initiation
- **Encounters should feel discovered** not presented
- **Use environmental cues** to draw player attention
- **NPCs should have their own agendas** driving interactions
- **Time-based encounters** should feel like natural schedule conflicts

**Example of Organic Initiation**: Instead of "You see Marcus looking upset," try "As you round the corner toward Charms class, you nearly collide with Marcus, whose red-rimmed eyes and clenched jaw suggest he's just come from an unpleasant encounter. He mutters an apology and tries to push past you." The player can choose to engage or let him go.

**Example of Inevitable Encounter**: The player receives a summons to the Headmaster's office via enchanted letter that follows them persistently until acknowledged. While they must eventually go, they can choose when, how they prepare, and their attitude upon arrival.

## VI. Consequence Framework

### Consequence Categories
- **No Consequence**: 30% of encounters
- **Minor/Flavor**: 40% (NPC reactions, small callbacks)
- **Moderate**: 20% (affects future encounters)
- **Major**: 10% (significant story impact)

### Reversible vs. Permanent Consequences
- **Reversible**: Offended NPCs, lost house points, minor reputation damage
- **Permanent**: Revealed secrets, destroyed items, major betrayals, character deaths
- **Design both types thoughtfully** - permanent consequences create weight and meaning
- **Some doors, once closed, cannot be reopened** - make these moments clear in their gravity
- **Document which consequences can be undone** and what would be required

### Tracking Systems
- **Immediate Effects**: Occur within the same scene
- **Session Delays**: Manifest in the next gameplay session
- **Long Burns**: Develop over multiple sessions
- **Compound Results**: Multiple small choices creating larger impacts

### NPC Memory and Reactions
- **NPCs remember player actions** appropriately to their importance
- **Small slights create coolness**, major offenses create hostility
- **Positive actions build credit** for future interactions
- **Some NPCs gossip**, spreading reputation effects

## VII. Player Progression Systems

### Magical Development
- **Link spell learning to story progression** and character choices
- **Create meaningful advancement moments** rather than arbitrary levelups
- **Specializations emerge from player interests** not predetermined paths

### Loot Philosophy
- **Keep magical items rare and special**
- **Items should be useful but not game-breaking**
- **Consumables over permanent items** when possible
- **Story significance over mechanical power**

### Resource Management
- **Time as a resource**: Players can't do everything
- **Social capital**: Relationships require investment
- **Academic standing**: Affects available opportunities
- **Health and energy**: Consequences for overextension

## VIII. Campaign Management Tools

### Essential Documentation
- **Encounter Catalog**: Numbered encounters with full details including all outcomes and consequences
- **Active Effects Tracking**: Ongoing consequences and their durations
- **Timeline**: When key events occur
- **NPC Status Tracker**: Current locations, knowledge, and attitudes

### Location Details
- **Rich descriptions for each significant location**
- **Available encounters per location**
- **Hidden secrets and easter eggs**
- **Environmental challenges or benefits**

### Quick References
- **Common DCs for typical situations**
- **Spell availability by year**
- **House point guidelines**
- **Standard punishments and rewards**

## IX. Creating Your Campaign Plan

### Document Structure
Your campaign plan should include:

1. **Campaign Overview**
   - Core conflicts and mysteries
   - Thematic elements
   - General timeline

2. **Story Architecture**
   - Act structure (as many as needed)
   - Essential story beats
   - Optional narrative threads

3. **NPC Roster** 
   - Separate `firstname_lastname.md` files for full character sheets
   - Brief roster in main document with plot connections
   - Note which encounters each NPC appears in

4. **Encounter Catalog**
   - Number each encounter (E01, E02, etc.)
   - Full details including all outcomes and their consequences
   - Pre-determined DCs for all rolls
   - Combat requirements and creature stats
   - Detailed immediate and long-term effects

5. **Location Gazetteer**
   - Vivid descriptions of key locations
   - Available encounters
   - Environmental details
   - Hidden elements

### Planning Philosophy
- **Begin with your ending**: Know where stories can conclude
- **Build backwards**: Create paths leading to satisfying conclusions
- **Branch naturally**: Add optional content that enriches without requiring
- **Detail thoroughly**: Every element fully realized before play begins
- **Connect organically**: Even unrelated elements should feel part of the world
- **Start working early**: Plan a few encounters and story hooks that start soon into the story.

### Encounter Design Goals
- **Aim for 10-20 rich encounters** rather than many shallow ones
- **Each location** should have 2-3 potential encounters
- **Major NPCs** should appear in multiple encounters
- **Every encounter** needs complete mechanical preparation
- **Social encounters** require conversation outcome planning

### Quality Checks
- Test different player approaches mentally
- Verify critical information has multiple discovery methods
- Ensure failures lead somewhere interesting
- Confirm optional content feels rewarding but not mandatory
- Check that permanent consequences are clearly telegraphed in encounter descriptions
- Review that all outcomes and their ripple effects are thoroughly documented
